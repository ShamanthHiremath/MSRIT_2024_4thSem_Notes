Trace packets using Wireshark for IP, ICMP  and Answer the following Questions:
Use the following command to change the ICMP packet size.
Ping <ipaddress/url> -s <packet size> 
example:- ping makemytrip.com -s 2000
    1. Select the first ICMP Echo Request message sent by your computer, and expand the Internet Protocol part of the packet in the packet details window. What is the IP address of your computer?
    2. Within the IP packet header, what is the value in the upper layer protocol field?
    3. How many bytes are in the IP header? How many bytes are in the payload of the IP datagram? Explain how you determined the number of payload bytes.
    4. Has this IP datagram been fragmented? Explain how you determined whether or not the datagram has been fragmented.
    5. Which fields in the IP datagram always change from one datagram to the next within this series of ICMP messages sent by your computer?
    6. Which fields stay constant? 
    7. Find the first ICMP Echo Request message that was sent by your computer after you changed the Packet Size to be 2000. Has that message been fragmented across more than one IP datagram?
    8. Write the first fragment of the fragmented IP datagram. What information in the IP header indicates that the datagram has been fragmented? What information in the IP header indicates whether this is the first fragment versus a latter fragment? How long is this IP datagram?
    9. What information in the IP header indicates that this is not the first datagram fragment? Are there more fragments? How can you tell?
    10. What fields change in the IP header between the first and second fragment?
