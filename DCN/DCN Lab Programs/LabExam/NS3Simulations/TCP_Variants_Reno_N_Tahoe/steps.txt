Difficulty Level: Easy (Just a 5 min read and you are good to go)

Copy "tcp-variants-comparison.cc" to scratch and rename it

Changes:
1. On line 351 change value of bool tracing to true.
2. On line 345, you can change value of std::string transport_prot to any of the protocol from lines 366 to 369 (or leave it to "TcpWestwoodPlus").
3. Run the ns3 program (no need of visualizer i.e. --vis).
4. Go to ns3 folder and find a .cwnd file, paste all the values from the file in a spreadsheet (Libre-Office) and generate its graph (click insert -> chart -> preferably line graph).
5. Repeat "step 4" for a ".rtt file."
6. On line 345 change value of std::string transport_prot to some other protocol and and repeat steps 3, 4 and 5 again.

Finally you will have 4 graphs as observation/output
