4. Trace Internet Protocol and Internet Control Message Protocol using Wireshark.

a) Select the first ICMP Echo Request message sent by your computer, and expand the Internet 
Protocol part of the packet in the packet details window. What is the IP address ofyour 
computer?


b) Within the IP packet header, what is the value in the upper layer protocol field?


c) How many bytes are in the IP header? How many bytes are in the payload of the IP
datagram? Explain how you determined the number of payload bytes.


d) Has this IP datagram been fragmented? Explain how you determined whether or not the
datagram has been fragmented.


e) Which fields in the IP datagram always change from one datagram to the next within this
series of ICMP messages sent by your computer?


f) Which fields stay constant?


g) Find the first ICMP Echo Request message that was sent by your computer after you
changed the Packet Size to 2000 (Use command ping â€“s 2000 www.msrit.edu to change the 
MTU of the packet). Has that message been fragmented across more than one IP datagram


h) Write down the first fragment of the fragmented IP datagram. What information in the IP
header indicates that the datagram been fragmented? What information in the IP header
indicates whether this is the first fragment versus a latter fragment? How long is this IP
datagram?


i) What information in the IP header indicates that this is not the first datagram fragment? Are
there more fragments? How can you tell? What fields change in the IP headerbetween
the first and second fragment?
