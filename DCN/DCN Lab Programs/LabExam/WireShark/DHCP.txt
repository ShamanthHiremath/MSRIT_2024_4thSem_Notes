Trace Packets using Wireshark for DHCP and Answer the following Questions:

Use ipconfig/release and ipconfig/renew commands.

1.  Are DHCP messages sent over UDP or TCP?
Ans: Sent over UDP

2.  What is the link-layer (e.g., Ethernet) address of your host?
Ans: The link-layer address (MAC address) can be found in the Ethernet frame of the DHCP packets("Source" address in the Ethernet header).
ff: ff: ff: ff: ff

3.	What values in the DHCP discover message differentiate this message from the DHCP request message?
Ans: The DHCP Discover message has the "Message type: Discover (1)" option, whereas the DHCP Request message has the "Message type: Request (3)" option in the DHCP options field.

4.	What is the value of the Transaction-ID in each of the first four (discover/Offer/Request/ACK) DHCP messages? What are 
the values of the Transaction-ID in the second set (Request/ACK) of DHCP messages? What is the purpose of the Transaction-ID field?
Ans: TransactionID of first 4 messages is same: 0x12f9e762
TransactionID of second 4 messages is same but different than 1st 4: 0x38120d67

5.	A host uses DHCP to obtain an IP address, among other things. But a host’s IP address is not confirmed until the end of the four-message exchange! If the IP address is not set until the end of the four-message exchange, then what values are used in the IP datagrams in the four-message exchange? For each of the four DHCP messages (Discover/Offer/ Request/ACK DHCP), indicate the source and destination IP addresses that are carried in the encapsulating IP datagram.
Ans: If it is not set, DHCP server uses 0.0.0.0 and client uses 255.255.255.255
Discover and Request have Src: 0.0.0.0 and Dest: 255.255.255.255
Offer and ACK haveSrc: 172.1.6.1 and Dest: 172.1.6.99

6.	What is the IP address of your DHCP server?
Ans: IP Address of DHCP: 172.1.6.10

7.	What IP address is the DHCP server offering to your host in the DHCP Offer message? Indicate which DHCP message contains the offered DHCP address.
Ans: IP Address 172.1.6.99 is offered to the host by the server, (Offer message has it)

8.	What values in the trace indicate the absence of a relay agent? Is there a relay agent in your experiment? If so what is the IP address of the agent?
Ans: The absence of a relay agent is indicated by field being 0.0.0.0
Yes, there is a relay agent, its IP Address is 172.1.6.1

9.	Explain the purpose of the lease time. What is the lease time value in your experiment?
Ans: The lease time is the duration for which the DHCP server grants the IP address to the client.
It is specified in the "IP Address Lease Time" option in the DHCP Offer and DHCP ACK messages.
Here it is 8 days, 8hrs

10.	What is the purpose of the DHCP release message? Does the DHCP server issue an acknowledgment of receipt of the client’s DHCP request? 
Ans: The purpose of the DHCP release message is to inform the DHCP server that the client is releasing its IP address and no longer needs it.
No, the DHCP server does not issue an acknowledgment for the DHCP release message.
